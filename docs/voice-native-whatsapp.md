# Voice-Native WhatsApp Stack

This document describes the local Hermes + `voice` integration path for
WhatsApp voice notes and WhatsApp Calling/WebRTC experiments.

The target shape is:

- `voice` is the source of truth for speech audio formats.
- Hermes asks `voice` for WhatsApp-ready Ogg/Opus files for voice notes.
- Hermes sends native Opus voice notes without a redundant ffmpeg conversion.
- Hermes uses a local WebRTC sidecar for WhatsApp Calling SDP and PCM frame
  exchange.
- `voice` keeps the local media contract stable through
  `voice stream-contract`.

## Components

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `voice say --format ogg-opus` | Writes completed WhatsApp-ready Ogg/Opus voice-note files. |
| `voice stream` | Emits raw 48 kHz mono 20 ms PCM frames or streamed Ogg/Opus files. |
| `voice stream-transcribe` | Transcribes files or decoded PCM frames from the sidecar. |
| `voice-webrtc-sidecar.service` | Runs the Python `aiortc` sidecar from the `voice` checkout. |
| `hermes-gateway.service` drop-in | Points the running gateway at the checkout and sidecar stream command. |
| `scripts/install_voice_local_stack.py` | Produces or applies the local systemd/config wiring. |
| `scripts/verify_voice_local_stack.py` | Proves the isolated and optional live local voice stack. |
| `scripts/verify_voice_live_gateway.py` | Proves the installed gateway process and sidecar are in sync. |

## Install Plan

Install and start the `voice` daemon before applying the Hermes wiring. On
Linux, `voice daemon install` registers and starts the `voiced.service`
systemd user unit. The sidecar unit generated below orders after that daemon
and pulls it in with `Wants=voiced.service`.

```bash
voice daemon install
voice daemon status
```

Run the installer in dry-run mode first. The output is JSON with the files it
would write and the verifier commands to run afterward.

```bash
python3 scripts/install_voice_local_stack.py \
  --hermes-home ~/.hermes \
  --live-hermes-root ~/.hermes/hermes-agent-voice-stack \
  --voice-repo ~/code/src/github.com/rgbkrk/voice \
  --voice-bin ~/.local/bin/voice \
  --voice-daemon-service voiced.service \
  --webrtc-python-bin /tmp/voice-webrtc-venv/bin/python \
  --configure-tts \
  --configure-stt
```

Use `--apply` to write the systemd user unit, gateway drop-in, and optional
Hermes TTS/STT config updates. Use `--restart-hermes` when the gateway should
reload the new drop-in immediately.

```bash
python3 scripts/install_voice_local_stack.py \
  --apply \
  --restart-hermes \
  --hermes-home ~/.hermes \
  --live-hermes-root ~/.hermes/hermes-agent-voice-stack \
  --voice-repo ~/code/src/github.com/rgbkrk/voice \
  --voice-bin ~/.local/bin/voice \
  --voice-daemon-service voiced.service \
  --webrtc-python-bin /tmp/voice-webrtc-venv/bin/python \
  --configure-tts \
  --configure-stt
```

The generated TTS provider asks `voice` for native Opus:

```yaml
tts:
  provider: kokoro
  providers:
    kokoro:
      type: command
      command: voice say --format ogg-opus --input-file {input_path} --output {output_path} --voice {voice} --speed {speed}
      output_format: ogg
      voice_compatible: true
```

The generated STT provider routes files through `voice stream-transcribe`:

```yaml
stt:
  enabled: true
  provider: voice
  providers:
    voice:
      type: command
      command: voice stream-transcribe --quiet {input_path}
      format: txt
```

## Verification

The installer prints five verifier commands under `verify_commands`:

| Key | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `local_stack` | Isolated local checks without touching the running gateway. |
| `live_gateway` | Running-gateway checks only. |
| `live_gateway_cloud_only` | Running-gateway checks only, skipping local Baileys bridge health. |
| `local_stack_live_gateway` | Full local stack plus running-gateway checks. |
| `local_stack_live_gateway_cloud_only` | Same as `local_stack_live_gateway`, but skips local Baileys bridge health. |

For a local Cloud-API-focused deployment, run the generated
`local_stack_live_gateway_cloud_only` command. It should include:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_voice_local_stack.py \
  --voice-bin ~/.local/bin/voice \
  --voice-repo ~/code/src/github.com/rgbkrk/voice \
  --webrtc-python-bin /tmp/voice-webrtc-venv/bin/python \
  --live-hermes-root ~/.hermes/hermes-agent-voice-stack \
  --run-live-gateway \
  --calling-sidecar-url http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
  --live-gateway-python-bin ~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python \
  --live-gateway-hermes-home ~/.hermes \
  --run-live-gateway-stt-smoke \
  --live-gateway-sidecar-service voice-webrtc-sidecar.service \
  --live-gateway-voice-daemon-service voiced.service \
  --skip-live-gateway-bridge-health
```

That aggregate verifier proves:

- `voice` can produce WhatsApp-ready Ogg/Opus.
- `voice stream-contract` matches the checked-in sidecar contract.
- Hermes command TTS returns `voice_compatible: true` Opus voice-note media.
- Hermes command STT transcribes through `voice stream-transcribe`.
- `voice stream` returns raw 48 kHz mono 20 ms PCM frames.
- The local Baileys bridge keeps native `.ogg`/`.opus` media as voice notes
  when the bridge check is not skipped.
- The WhatsApp Cloud adapter uploads `.ogg`/Opus with
  `audio/ogg; codecs=opus`.
- The synthetic WhatsApp Calling control plane gates accept on sidecar
  readiness.
- A real local sidecar can answer an `aiortc` SDP offer and report
  `ready_for_accept: true`.
- The installed `hermes-gateway.service` process imports from the expected
  checkout and points at the expected sidecar URL.
- The installed `voiced.service` daemon is active and runs the expected
  `voice daemon start` command for live-call stream TTS.
- The installed `voice-webrtc-sidecar.service` runs the expected `voice` binary
  and `voice` checkout.

## Readiness Boundary

The local WebRTC sidecar exposes `state.ready_for_accept` and per-check
`state.readiness` booleans. Hermes should send WhatsApp Graph `pre_accept` and
`accept` only after the sidecar reports `ready_for_accept: true`.

This local proof does not contact Meta's Graph API, receive a real WhatsApp
Calling webhook, or prove media against a real WhatsApp client. It proves the
local Hermes/voice boundary up to the point where an external WhatsApp
Calling event can be handed to the sidecar and accepted safely.

## Troubleshooting

- If `--run-sidecar-offer-smoke` fails, inspect the sidecar `/health` and
  `/contract` endpoints first.
- If Opus checks fail, make sure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are installed and on
  `PATH`.
- If the live verifier imports old code, confirm the gateway systemd drop-in
  sets `PYTHONPATH` to the intended checkout.
- If the sidecar service check fails, confirm `VOICE_BIN`, `WorkingDirectory`,
  `--host`, and `--port` in `systemctl --user show voice-webrtc-sidecar.service`.
